# VBA Stock Market Data Analysis
Used VBA scripting to analyze real stock market data.

Created a script that will loop through all the stocks for one year for each run and take the following information:

-The symbol.
-Yearly change from opening price at the beginning of a given year to the closing price at the end of that year.
-The percent change from opening price at the beginning of a given year to the closing price at the end of that year.
-The total stock volume of the stock.
-Conditional formatting that will highlight positive change in green and negative change in red.
-Returned the stock with the "Greatest % increase", "Greatest % Decrease" and "Greatest total volume"
